### Contributing

Many Haxe developers have used erazor, but it has not been clear which fork on Github is the "official" version, with different forks having different fixes and patches applied.

This repository has been created so that there is a central place to contribute, so pull requests, bug reports, and documentation are all welcome!

If you would like direct commit access, send at least one good pull request and we'll let you in!
